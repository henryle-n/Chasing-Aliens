# ::: Area 51: Home of Flying Saucers, where else? :::
## Background
In this project, a JavaScript array of **111** objects were used to construct a web-based app to help users quickly query the data based on different input conditions. 

There are two different websites built for this project.  
* Lev-1 consists of a simple "*Date*" filter input. <a href="https://henryle-n.github.io/JavaScript-Challenge/UFO-level-1/">**Click here**</a> for UFO webpage level-1 <br>

* Lev-2 consists of multiple filtering inputs, such as: "*Date*", "*City*", "*State*", "*Country*", "*Shape*" that allows user to further "tune-up" the query. <a href="https://henryle-n.github.io/JavaScript-Challenge/UFO-level-2/">**Click here**</a> for UFO webpage level-2

I'm very excited upon finishing up both of the levels as each of them gave me a different approach dealing with the level of complication. For the lev-1, I made it very simple for just getting the date and filtering it directly inside the on-click function. Lev-2 in another hand, is a complete different way of filtering the data. I learned about more or less "advanced" filter function where the 2nd argument can be passed in the filter to create more dynamic filtering based on user inputs. The filter conditions is an object that its length and content are changed based on how many and what conditions are fed into the input boxes from user. It took me two days with different ideas and trials and errors to finally found what works. The "this" keyword worked very well in for this model of filtering.
